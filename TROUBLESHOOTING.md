# HVAC Study Site Troubleshooting

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Flashcards Not Displaying
The primary issue was that flashcards weren't displaying on the website. Several factors were causing this:

- **Missing JSON Module Import**: The `json` module was not imported in `app/models/content/flashcards.py`, causing the JSON parsing to fail.
- **JavaScript Module Issues**: The flashcards page was using ES6 module imports, but the server wasn't set up to serve these properly.
- **API Endpoint Access**: The client-side code wasn't able to properly access the API endpoint due to fetch errors.

### 2. Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Database Access**:
   - Added the missing `import json` to the flashcards module.
   - Verified that data was being stored correctly in the SQLite database.
   - Created a test script (`test_api_cli.py`) to verify API functionality.

2. **Simplified JavaScript Implementation**:
   - Replaced the modular approach with an inline script directly in the template.
   - Implemented proper error handling with fallback to the static JSON file.
   - Added loading indicators to improve user experience.

3. **Streamlined UI**:
   - Added a loading spinner while flashcard data is being fetched.
   - Made the card display more resilient to data variations.

## Verification

The application now successfully:
- Fetches flashcard data from the database
- Falls back to the static JSON file if the API fails
- Displays flashcards correctly in both list and study mode
- Handles all interactions (filtering, searching, flipping cards)

## Remaining Considerations

1. In the future, you may want to implement proper ES6 module support by configuring your server to serve JavaScript modules correctly.

2. The current implementation embeds the JavaScript directly in the template for simplicity and reliability, but a more modular approach would be better for maintainability as the application grows.

3. For improved performance, consider implementing pagination or lazy loading for large flashcard sets.

4. Keep monitoring the API endpoint to ensure it remains responsive, as it's a critical part of the application.
